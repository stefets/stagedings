# NOTE: This is a transitional repository to refactor the Flaskdings API with FastApi as the backend to replace Flask.

## UPDATE 2024-12-23: This repository also serves to be properly configured before being offered to the mididings organization (community version) who will maintain and support the UI in the future.
